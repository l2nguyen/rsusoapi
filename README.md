A R package with wrapper functions to facilitate the use of the Survey Solutions API.

### Prerequisites
These programs uses R to interact with the Survey Solutions API so you will need to install R and R Studio on your computer.

* [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

You will also need to make an API user account on your survey server. Learn how to make an API user account on the [support page](http://support.mysurvey.solutions/customer/en/portal/articles/2844104-survey-solutions-api?b_id=12728).

### Installation
To install this package, run the following code:
``` r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("l2nguyen/susoapir")
```

Unfortunately, this package can only currently be installed from GitHub and not CRAN. We hope to submit this package to CRAN in the future.

### Issues or suggestions
