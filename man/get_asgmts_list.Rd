  version = NULL,
  responsible = "",
  archived = FALSE,
  output = "df",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{template_id}{Template ID for the questionnaire. This can either have dashes or not.}

questinnaire name instead of the template ID. \emph{Do not specify both the template_id
and qx_name.}}

\item{version}{Version of questionnaire.}

\item{responsible}{Option to filter by the user responsible for the assignment. By
default, it will find all assignments for the questionnaire regardless of who is
responsible.}

\item{archived}{Option to search for archived assignments. If TRUE, the assignment list
will only show archived assignments. By default, the list will only show active
assignments.}

\item{output}{Desired output type for the list of assignments.
Options are: "df" for data frame, "tab" for tab delimited file or
"excel" for an Excel file. By default, it is a data frame.}

\item{output_path}{Name of the file that you would like to save the output as.
This \emph{must} be specified if the output type is tab or excel.
It is recommended to use forward slash (/) instead of backslash (\\).}

\item{server}{Prefix for the survey server. It is whatever comes before
mysurvey.solutions: [prefix].mysurvey.solutions.}

\item{user}{Username for the API user on the server.}

\item{password}{Password for the API user on the server.}

\description{
\code{get_asgmts_list} gets information about the assignments for a certain version of a
questionnaire. The user can find the questionnaire of interest using the template ID for
the questionnaire or the name of the questionnaire. The user can also filter the list
based on archived status and the interviewer/supervisor currently responsible
for the assignment.

## Using template ID
all_assignments <- get_asgmts_list(template_id = "68b8a85fd7a84c45b4bb0c2c1c19c53f",
version=3, server = "lfs2018",
user = "APIuser2018", password = "SafePassword123")

## Using questionnaire name
all_assign_use_qx <- get_asgmts_list(qx_name = "Labour Force Survey 2018 Q1",
 version=3, server = "lfs2018", user = "APIuser2018", password = "SafePassword123")

## Filter by user responsible
super1_assignments <- get_asgmts_list(qx_name = "Labour Force Survey 2018 Q1",
 version=3, responsible="Supervisor1",
 server = "lfs2018", user = "APIuser2018", password = "SafePassword123")

## Export to Excel
get_asgmts_list(qx_name = "Labour Force Survey 2018 Q1", version=3,
output = "excel",
output_path="/User/bar/Documents/active_assignments.xlsx",
server = "lfs2018", user = "APIuser2018",
password = "SafePassword123")
